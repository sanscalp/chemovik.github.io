# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

You can report issues by emailing:

**wegrindinglately@gmail.com** *(replace this with your email)*

### 🕒 Response Time

We aim to respond to security reports within **48–72 hours**. Please give us time to investigate and resolve the issue before disclosing it publicly.

### 🔐 Private Reporting (Recommended)

We strongly recommend enabling [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guiding-users-to-report-security-issues-with-a-security-policy#enabling-private-vulnerability-reporting), so users can notify you confidentially via GitHub.
